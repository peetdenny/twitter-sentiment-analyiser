# Twitter Sentiment Stream "Stock price analysis"

I wanted to see what I could get done in an hour.  
Finished all the functionality in an hour, but then needed a further 6 minutes to fix a defect, create this github project and commit.

To run:
```
python twitter_parser.py <term> <limit>
```
where term is the hashtag you want to track and limit is the max number of tweets you want to receive
